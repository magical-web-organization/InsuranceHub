Dental insurance is a type of health insurance designed to help individuals pay for dental care expenses. It typically covers preventive dental care, such as cleanings and check-ups, as well as restorative treatments, such as fillings and root canals. However, like most insurance types, dental insurance only covers a portion of the total cost.

This is where out-of-network dental care comes in. Patients have the option to choose between in-network and out-of-network care, but the latter is usually accompanied by higher out-of-pocket expenses. However, there are times when out-of-network care is a better option. In this article, we will explain dental insurance and out-of-network care, its advantages, and when it is beneficial for a patient.

## What Is Dental Insurance?

Dental insurance is designed to cover a portion of the total cost for dental care. This insurance usually has different coverage areas, including preventive care and restorative care. Preventive dental care covers routine dental cleanings and exams, fluoride treatments, and sealants. Restorative care includes fillings, root canals, and crowns. However, the coverage may vary from one insurance provider to another.

## In-Network Versus Out-of-Network Dental Care

In-network dental care refers to care from a dentist who is listed in the insurance provider's network. Generally, dental insurance companies have pre-determined rates with these in-network dentists, making this care more economical. On the other hand, out-of-network dental care refers to services received from a dentist who is not within the insurance company's network. Out-of-network care usually involves higher out-of-pocket expenses for the patient.

## Advantages of Out-of-Network Care

Despite the higher costs, there are still some advantages to getting out-of-network dental care. Here are some examples:

* **Freedom of choice.** Out-of-network care allows patients to choose a dentist who is not limited to the network covered by the insurance company.
* **Geographical convenience.** Patients may not have access to in-network providers in their area, and it may be more convenient to seek out-of-network care.
* **Quality of care.** Some patients find that the quality of care they receive from an out-of-network dentist is worth the additional cost.

## When to Consider Out-of-Network Dental Care

It's important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of out-of-network dental care before making a decision. Here are some factors to consider when deciding whether or not to choose out-of-network care:

* **Cost.** Out-of-network care usually involves higher out-of-pocket expenses, so be sure to check with your insurance provider to learn how much you'll be paying for an out-of-network dental care provider.
* **Urgency.** If you need dental care urgently, you may not have time to research in-network providers. You may need to receive treatment from an out-of-network dentist.
* **Specific dental care needs.** If you have a specific dental care need, such as implants or cosmetic dental work, an out-of-network dentist may be the better choice for quality of care.

## Conclusion

Dental insurance usually covers only a portion of the total dental care cost. Patients that choose out-of-network care have more flexibility in choosing a dentist, may receive higher-quality care, but also have to bear higher expenses. Before getting treatment, it is essential to review the advantages and disadvantages of in-network and out-of-network dental care, as well as verifying with their insurance providers the extent of coverage.
