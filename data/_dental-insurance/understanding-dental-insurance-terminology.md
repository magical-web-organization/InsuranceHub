## Introduction
Dental insurance is essential to help offset the cost of routine check-ups, fillings, and more extensive procedures like root canals or extractions. Understanding dental insurance terminology is essential to figure out what covered and can help maximize your benefits.

## Common Terms

Here are several frequently encountered terms when dealing with dental insurance:

### Premium

The premium is the amount you pay each month or year to keep your dental insurance active. These payments don't apply to your care, and you'll have to pay deductibles or copays in addition to premiums.
  
### Deductible

The deductible is the amount you'll have to pay before dental insurance coverage kicks in. It typically applies to more expensive procedures, though some plans may waive the deductible fees for preventative care. 

### Copayment

A copayment (or copay) is a set amount you pay for a particular dental procedure. The amount varies by insurance plans and as per the services you get. 

### Coinsurance 

Coinsurance refers to the percentage of the cost of a dental procedure that you're responsible for paying after paying the deductible. It's typically expressed in the form of a ratio, such as 80/20, where the insurance company is responsible for 80% of the cost, and you're responsible for the remaining 20%.

### Out Of Pocket Maximum

The out-of-pocket maximum is how much you'll have to pay for your dental services before your dental insurance pays 100% of the rest of the costs.

### In-Network

Dental insurance companies often create relationships with certain dental offices. In-network services refer to the services you receive from an intentionally contracted provider, and youâ€™ll enjoy more significant insurance benefits from these dental providers.

### Out Of Network

Out-of-network services refer to the services you receive from dental providers outside the dental insurance network. You'll likely have to pay a more significant portion of the procedure costs.

### Waiting Period

A waiting period is the period where you must wait after signing up for dental insurance or renewing your plan before you can use your coverage.

### Pre-Authorization or Predetermination

The insurance company approves coverage to a dental procedure before it is performed by preauthorization. Predetermination is the method where insurance company reviews the procedure coverage and provide the percentage of total procedure cost that will be paid by your dental insurance plan.
