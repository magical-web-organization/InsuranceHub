Many people believe that dental insurance covers all types of dental procedures, including cosmetic dentistry. However, the truth is that dental insurance typically only covers treatments that are medically necessary. Cosmetic dentistry is usually not deemed medically necessary by insurance companies, so it is not usually covered by dental insurance.

Let's take a closer look at how dental insurance covers cosmetic dentistry and what procedures may be covered.

### What is Cosmetic Dentistry?

Cosmetic dentistry refers to dental procedures that enhance the appearance of your teeth, gums, or bite. These treatments may not necessarily improve your overall oral health, but they can boost your self-esteem and confidence.

Some examples of cosmetic dentistry procedures include:

- Teeth whitening
- Dental bonding
- Veneers
- Orthodontics
- Dental implants
- Gum contouring
- Full mouth reconstruction

### How Does Dental Insurance Cover Cosmetic Dentistry?

As mentioned earlier, dental insurance typically only covers treatments that are deemed medically necessary. Cosmetic dentistry is usually not regarded as medically necessary, so dental insurance may not cover it. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule.

For instance, some dental insurance plans may cover orthodontic treatment, such as braces or Invisalign, if the treatment is deemed medically necessary. If your crooked teeth are causing problems with your bite, then your orthodontic treatment may be covered by your dental insurance.

In addition, some dental insurance plans may cover certain procedures, like dental implants or full mouth reconstruction, if the treatment is necessary for a medical condition, such as a jaw deformity or missing teeth due to injury.

It is important to note that each dental insurance plan is different, and coverage may vary depending on your specific plan. If you are considering cosmetic dentistry, it is important to check with your dental insurance provider about your coverage options.

### Alternatives to Dental Insurance for Cosmetic Dentistry

If your dental insurance does not cover cosmetic dentistry, there are other options for paying for these procedures. Some dentists may offer payment plans or financing options to help make the cost more manageable.

Additionally, you can consider using a dental savings plan, such as those offered by companies like CareCredit or DentalPlans. These plans provide discounts on dental procedures, including some cosmetic dentistry treatments, and can be a great way to save money on dental care.

### Conclusion

Dental insurance typically only covers treatments that are deemed medically necessary, so cosmetic dentistry may not be covered by your insurance plan. However, there may be certain exceptions to this rule, and it is always best to check with your dental insurance provider about your coverage options.

If your dental insurance does not cover cosmetic dentistry, there are other ways to pay for these procedures, such as payment plans, financing options, or dental savings plans. Remember, cosmetic dentistry can improve your self-esteem and confidence, so it may be worth investing in these treatments even if they are not covered by your insurance.
