# Pre-Existing Conditions and Travel Insurance: Understanding How Pre-Existing Conditions Impact Coverage

When planning a trip, it's easy to get caught up in booking flights, making hotel reservations and planning out your itinerary. But as a wise traveler once said, it's better to be safe than sorry – and that's where travel insurance comes in. Travel insurance offers protection against unexpected events such as medical emergencies, trip cancellations and lost luggage.

However, if you have a pre-existing medical condition, it's important to understand how this could impact your travel insurance coverage. In this article, we'll explain everything you need to know about pre-existing conditions and travel insurance.

## What is a Pre-Existing Condition?

A pre-existing condition is a medical condition that you have before buying a travel insurance policy. Examples of pre-existing conditions include diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and asthma. These conditions could lead to complications during your trip or require medical treatment while you're away.

## How Can Pre-Existing Conditions Impact Your Travel Insurance Coverage?

Pre-existing conditions can have a significant impact on your travel insurance coverage. Depending on your policy, your pre-existing condition may not be covered at all, or even if it is, you may be subject to additional premiums or excess payments.

When you purchase travel insurance, you'll be asked to fill out a medical declaration form. This form will ask if you have any pre-existing medical conditions. It's crucial to be truthful when filling out this form – if you don't declare your pre-existing condition and then require medical treatment while traveling, your claim may be denied.

## What Options Do Travelers with Pre-Existing Conditions Have?

If you have a pre-existing condition and are worried about travel insurance, don't despair. Many insurers offer policies that cover pre-existing conditions, although you may need to pay additional premiums or an excess.

One popular option for travelers with pre-existing conditions is a medical-only travel insurance policy. This type of policy covers medical treatment and emergency medical assistance in case of illness or injury. It's also important to read the policy wording and compare different policies to ensure you get the best coverage for your needs.

Another option is to purchase a policy that includes a pre-existing medical condition waiver. This type of policy covers any claims related to your pre-existing condition, although it may come with specific terms and limitations.

## Conclusion

Pre-existing conditions are a fact of life for many travelers. If you have a pre-existing condition, it's important to understand how this could impact your travel insurance coverage and what options you have for securing coverage. By shopping around and reading the policy wording carefully, you can find a policy that meets your needs and gives you peace of mind while you're traveling.
