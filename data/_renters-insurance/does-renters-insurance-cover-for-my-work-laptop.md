## Introduction

Having a work laptop that you frequently take home can cause some confusion about whether or not it’s covered under your renters insurance. While your employer may provide you with property insurance, it may not cover the device when you take it outside of the office.

In this article, we’ll explore whether or not renters insurance covers your work laptop, and what to do if it doesn’t.

## Does renters insurance cover work laptops?

If you have renters insurance, your policy may cover your work laptop, but there are certain limitations. Renters insurance typically provides coverage for personal belongings, including laptops and other electronics, up to a certain value.

However, most renters insurance policies have exclusions for business property. This means that if your work laptop is used solely for business purposes, it may not be covered by your renters insurance.

It is important to review your policy and speak with your insurance provider to understand what is covered and what is not. If your policy does not cover your work laptop, you may need to purchase additional insurance to protect it.

## What to do if your work laptop is not covered by renters insurance?

If your work laptop is not covered by your renters insurance, there are options to protect it. Your employer may have insurance coverage for the device, or you may be able to purchase separate insurance specifically for the laptop.

It's important to also take steps to protect the laptop from theft or damage. Consider using a security cable or lock to secure it while you’re away from home. Also, always keep the laptop in a safe place to prevent accidental damage.

## Conclusion

Renters insurance may cover your work laptop, but it typically has exclusions for business property. If your policy doesn’t cover your work laptop, you’ll need to explore other options to protect it.

Be sure to review your renters insurance policy and discuss your needs with your insurance provider to ensure you have the right level of coverage for your belongings, including your work laptop.
