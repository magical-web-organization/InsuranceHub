## What Does Earthquake Insurance Cover?

Earthquake insurance is a type of insurance that covers damage to your property and belongings caused by an earthquake. It is important to understand what your earthquake insurance policy covers, as not all policies are created equal. Generally, earthquake insurance will cover the following types of damages:

### 1\. Structural Damage

Earthquakes can cause significant damage to the structure of your home or property, including the foundation, walls, roofing, and other structural components. Earthquake insurance typically covers the cost of repairing or rebuilding structural damage caused by an earthquake.

### 2\. Personal Property Damage

Your personal property, including furniture, appliances, and clothing, can also be damaged in an earthquake. Earthquake insurance can cover the cost of repair or replacement of your personal property.

### 3\. Additional Living Expenses

If you are unable to live in your home due to earthquake damage, earthquake insurance may cover the additional living expenses you incur while you are displaced. This can include things like hotel bills, meals, and other expenses.

### 4\. Business Interruption

If you own a business and it is interrupted due to earthquake damage, earthquake insurance may provide coverage for lost income and extra expenses that are necessary to resume business operations.

## What Types of Damage are Excluded?

While earthquake insurance can provide broad coverage for earthquake damage, there are some types of damages that may be excluded from typical policies. These include:

### 1\. Flood Damage

Earthquake insurance policies typically do not cover flood damage. If your property is damaged by flooding caused by an earthquake, you will need separate flood insurance to cover the damages.

### 2\. Landscaping and Outdoor Features

Earthquake insurance generally does not cover damage to landscaping or outdoor features like swimming pools, fountains, or patios.

### 3\. Non\-Earthquake Related Damage

Damage caused by other events, even if they occur during an earthquake, may not be covered by earthquake insurance. For example, if a fire breaks out during an earthquake and causes damage to your property, earthquake insurance may not cover the damages.

## Conclusion

Earthquake insurance can provide important protection in the event of an earthquake. It is important to understand what your policy covers and what types of damages may be excluded. Speak to your insurance provider to learn more about earthquake insurance and how you can protect your property.
