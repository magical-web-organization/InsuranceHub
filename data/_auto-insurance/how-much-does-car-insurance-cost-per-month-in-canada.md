Car insurance is mandatory for every driver in Canada. It provides financial protection in case of accidents, theft, or damages. But, how much does car insurance cost per month in Canada? Let's find out.

## Average monthly car insurance cost in Canada

The average monthly cost of car insurance in Canada ranges between $70 to $160. However, the cost may vary based on various factors like age, gender, driving history, location, type of car, and coverage.

## Factors affecting car insurance cost in Canada

### Age and Gender

Young drivers below the age of 25 years and male drivers tend to pay more for car insurance than others. This is because they are more likely to get involved in accidents or violate traffic rules.

### Driving History

Your driving history plays a significant role in determining your car insurance premium. If you have a clean driving record with no accidents or violations, you can expect to pay a lower premium. On the other hand, drivers with a history of accidents or tickets may have to pay more.

### Location

The place where you live also impacts your car insurance cost. Urban areas with high traffic and crime rates tend to have higher premiums compared to rural areas with lower traffic and crime rates.

### Type of Car

The make and model of your car can also affect your car insurance premium. Cars with higher safety ratings, advanced security features, and lower repair costs tend to have lower premiums.

### Coverage

The type and amount of coverage you choose also impact your car insurance cost. Comprehensive coverage that covers theft, fire, and other damages costs more than basic coverage that only covers damage to others.

## How to find the best car insurance deal in Canada?

To find the best car insurance deal, compare quotes from different insurance providers. You can use online comparison tools to compare rates and coverage options from various insurers.

It's also important to avoid speeding, drunk driving, and other traffic violations to maintain a clean driving record. This can help you qualify for lower premiums and discounts.

Final Thoughts

The cost of car insurance in Canada depends on several factors, including age, gender, driving history, location, type of car, and coverage. By considering these factors and comparing quotes from different insurers, you can find the best car insurance deal that suits your needs and budget.
