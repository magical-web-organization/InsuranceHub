Many people wonder if automobile insurance is legally required in every state. The answer may surprise you! In the United States, the laws regarding automobile insurance vary from state to state.

## Mandatory States

As of 2023, only two states do not require drivers to have automobile insurance: New Hampshire and Virginia. However, in these states, drivers must be able to prove that they have the financial means to cover any damages or injuries they cause in an accident.

## Liability Insurance

The majority of states require drivers to carry liability insurance. Liability insurance covers the costs of any damages or injuries you cause to another person or their vehicle in an accident.

## Additional Coverage

While liability insurance is the minimum requirement in most states, some states require additional types of coverage, such as personal injury protection (PIP) or uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage.

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

If you are caught driving without insurance in a state where it is required, you could face legal penalties, such as fines or even the suspension of your driver's license. It is important to make sure you have the proper coverage in place to avoid these consequences.

## Conclusion

While automobile insurance is not required in every state, the vast majority of states do require drivers to carry liability insurance or have proof of financial responsibility. It is important to understand the laws regarding automobile insurance in your state to avoid legal penalties and financial ruin in the event of an accident.
