If you have been in a car accident, one of the first things you should do is call the police. A police report will be generated detailing the events of the accident, who was involved, and who was at fault. This report can be essential when it comes to submitting a claim to your auto insurance company. But what happens if your insurance company ignores the police report? Let's find out.

## What is the Police Report?

A police report is an official document created by law enforcement officers after an accident. It contains important information about the accident, including the time, date, location, and the names and contact information of everyone involved. It also includes a description of the damage to the vehicles and any injuries sustained by the parties involved. Additionally, it typically details the officer's opinion on who is at fault for the accident.

## Can the Auto Insurance Company Ignore the Police Report?

Technically, yes, an auto insurance company can choose to ignore the police report. Insurance companies are not required by law to accept the police report as the final word in determining fault. However, it is not a common practice to ignore the police report. Insurance companies will typically use the police report as part of their investigation into the accident and as a piece of evidence when determining fault.

## Why Would an Insurance Company Ignore the Police Report?

There are a few reasons why an insurance company might ignore the police report. Firstly, the police officer who wrote the report may not have been a witness to the accident and may have relied on statements from the involved parties. Additionally, the report may contain errors or inconsistencies that the insurance company believes are inaccurate. In some cases, the insurance company may disagree with the officer's determination of fault and decide to conduct their own investigation.

## What Can You Do if Your Insurance Company Ignores the Police Report?

If your insurance company ignores the police report, you can appeal their decision. You can provide additional evidence or statements from witnesses to support your case. You can also hire an attorney to help you challenge the insurance company's decision.

## Takeaway

While it is within an auto insurance company's rights to ignore the police report, it is not a common practice. The police report is a valuable piece of evidence and is typically used as part of the investigation into the accident. If your insurance company ignores the police report, you can challenge their decision by providing additional evidence or hiring an attorney.
