Getting a license plate is a necessary step in registering your vehicle for use on public roads. However, before you can obtain your plates, certain requirements must be met. One of the questions that may arise is whether or not you can get a license plate without car insurance.

The answer is that it depends on the state in which you live.

## States That Require Car Insurance Prior to Getting a License Plate

Most states require that you have proof of sufficient car insurance coverage before you can obtain a license plate. This is because car insurance is a legal requirement in most states. Some states have a minimum that needs to be met, while others may require more comprehensive coverage.

States that require car insurance prior to getting a license plate include (but are not limited to):

* California
* Texas
* Ohio
* Florida
* New York
* Pennsylvania
* Michigan

If you live in a state that requires car insurance, you will need to provide proof of coverage before your license plates can be issued.

## States That Do Not Require Car Insurance Prior to Getting a License Plate

There are a handful of states that do not require car insurance before obtaining a license plate. These states allow for drivers to purchase plates for their vehicles without proof of insurance. However, this does not mean that you can operate your vehicle without insurance. In these states, you must purchase insurance and provide proof of coverage to legally operate a vehicle on public roads.

States that do not require car insurance prior to getting a license plate include:

* Virginia
* New Hampshire
* Tennessee
* Wisconsin
* Mississippi

## Conclusion

In summary, whether or not you can get a license plate without car insurance depends on the state in which you live. Check with your state's department of motor vehicles to determine the specific rules and requirements you need to follow if you want to have plates for your vehicle. Remember that even if your state does not require insurance prior to issuing a license plate, you still need to purchase insurance and provide proof of coverage to legally operate your vehicle on public roads.
