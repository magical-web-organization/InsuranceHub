If you own a rental property, you may be wondering if your existing homeowners insurance policy will extend to cover rental property damages. In this article, we'll dive into the details to give you a better understanding of what's covered under your homeowners insurance policy and what isn't.

## The Short Answer is No

Generally speaking, your standard homeowners insurance policy will not cover rental properties. The reason for this is that rental properties are considered a business venture and should be insured as such. To protect your rental property against damage from tenants, you'll need to invest in a separate insurance policy known as a landlord insurance policy.

## What is Landlord Insurance?

Landlord insurance, also known as rental property insurance, is a policy specifically designed for property owners who rent out one or more properties. This insurance policy provides coverage for your rental property, its contents, and general liability against injury claims filed by your tenants. Landlord insurance is typically more expensive than a standard homeowners insurance policy, but it is necessary to protect your investment.

## What Does Landlord Insurance Cover?

Landlord insurance policies typically offer the following coverages:

- Property Damage Protection: This coverage protects your rental property from damage resulting from natural disasters, theft, or vandalism.
- Liability Protection: This coverage protects you against claims for injuries sustained by your tenants or their guests while on your rental property.
- Loss of Income: This coverage reimburses you for lost rental income in the event your rental property becomes uninhabitable due to a covered loss.
- Personal Property Protection: This coverage protects any personal property you may have left on the rental property.

## Final Thoughts

If you're a rental property owner, you need to protect your investment with a landlord insurance policy. Your standard homeowners insurance policy will not offer any coverage for damages caused by tenants or income losses due to tenant displacement. To ensure you're adequately covered, contact your insurance agent to discuss your options and find the best policy for your rental property.
