Home insurance is a crucial investment in protecting your biggest asset – your home. But what exactly does home insurance cover? Here’s a breakdown of the different types of coverage that a typical home insurance policy includes.

## Dwelling coverage

Dwelling coverage is the part of your home insurance policy that covers physical damages to the structure of your home. This includes damages caused by covered perils such as fire, wind, hail, lightning, and vandalism. It typically pays to repair or rebuild your home in the event of a covered loss. 

## Personal property coverage

Personal property coverage pays for the repair or replacement of items inside your home that are damaged or destroyed in a covered loss. This includes furniture, electronics, clothing, and other personal possessions. Most policies will limit coverage for high-value items such as jewelry and artwork, so it is important to discuss those items with your insurance agent to ensure adequate coverage. 

## Liability coverage

Liability coverage protects you in the event that you are found legally responsible for injuries or damages to someone else’s property. Let’s say a visitor slips and falls on your icy driveway; your liability insurance would cover their medical expenses and any resulting lawsuits. Liability insurance also covers legal fees and judgments against you, up to the limits of your policy. 

## Additional living expenses coverage

Additional living expenses coverage pays for temporary living expenses if your home is uninhabitable due to a covered loss. This coverage typically includes the cost of a hotel room, food, transportation, and other necessary expenses while your home is being repaired or rebuilt. 

## Final thoughts

While the coverage amounts and types may vary depending on the insurer and the policy you choose, most home insurance policies include these four types of coverage. Talk to your insurance agent about your specific needs and risks to ensure that you have adequate protection for your home and belongings.
