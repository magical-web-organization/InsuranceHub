As a homeowner, you may be wondering if your insurance policy would cover a cracked tub. A compromised bathtub can be more than just an eyesore; it can pose a safety risk to your family as well.

## What Is Covered by Homeowners Insurance?

Typically, homeowners insurance covers damage to your home and belongings caused by certain perils such as fire, wind, and theft. It also provides liability protection if someone accidentally gets injured on your property. However, not all types of damage will be covered by your insurance policy.

## Will Homeowners Insurance Cover a Cracked Tub?

Whether or not your homeowners insurance will cover a cracked tub depends on the cause of the damage. If the crack in your tub occurred due to a covered peril, such as a fallen tree branch during a storm, you may be covered under your policy's dwelling coverage.

However, if the crack happened because of normal wear and tear, your insurance policy will not cover the repair or replacement costs.

## What Should You Do If Your Tub Is Cracked?

If your tub is cracked, the first step is to determine the cause of the damage. If it occurred due to a covered peril, contact your insurance provider right away.

If it is not a covered peril, and you're dealing with the aftermath of normal wear and tear damage, it is best to reach out to a plumbing professional to provide you with an estimate for the repair or replacement of your bathtub.

In conclusion, whether or not your homeowners insurance will cover a cracked tub depends on the cause of the damage. It is always best to contact your insurance provider before making any repairs to determine if you are covered. In any case, regular maintenance of your bathroom fixtures can help extend their lifespan, reducing the need for repairs or replacements in the future.
