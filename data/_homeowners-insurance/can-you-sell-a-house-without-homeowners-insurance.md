Selling a house requires a lot of preparation, from finding a real estate agent to staging the home and marketing it to potential buyers. But one aspect of selling a home that homeowners may overlook is homeowners insurance.

So, can you sell a house without homeowners insurance? The answer is technically yes. However, that doesn't mean you should. Here are some things to consider.

## The Risks of Selling a House Without Homeowners Insurance

If you choose not to have homeowners insurance while selling your house, you'll be liable for any damages that occur during the selling process. This means that if someone touring the home has an accident or becomes injured while on the property, you could be financially responsible for their medical bills and any other expenses related to their accident.

Similarly, if your home is damaged or destroyed by fire, natural disaster or any other calamity during the selling process, all repairs or replacement costs will be paid out of your pocket.

## Difficulty Finding Buyers

Another reason to keep homeowners insurance during the selling process is that many lenders won't approve a buyer's mortgage loan without evidence that the home is insured. This can make it difficult to find qualified buyers, which in turn can make it more challenging to sell your home.

## What if the House is Vacant?

If you've already moved out and your house is vacant while on the market, your insurance company could consider your coverage invalid. In this case, you'll need to obtain a different type of insurance policy known as vacant home insurance. This type of policy is specifically designed for unoccupied homes and provides protection for damages that may occur while the property is on the market.

## Conclusion

While it may be technically possible to sell a home without insurance, it's not recommended. By keeping your homeowners insurance in place during the selling process, you'll be better protected against potential losses and liabilities, and you'll have a better chance of finding qualified buyers.

Ultimately, it's in your best interest to work with your insurance agent and real estate agent to ensure you have the proper coverage in place before listing your home for sale.
