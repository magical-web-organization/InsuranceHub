Asbestos is a material that was commonly used in construction in the mid-20th century. It was a popular material because of its fireproofing and insulation properties. However, in recent years, asbestos has been linked to serious health problems like lung cancer and mesothelioma. If you own an older home, you may be wondering if your homeowner insurance covers the cost of asbestos removal. In this article, we'll explore the answer to this question.

## Does Homeowner Insurance Cover Asbestos Removal?

In most cases, homeowner insurance policies do not cover the cost of asbestos removal. This is because asbestos is considered a pre-existing condition, and insurance companies typically do not cover pre-existing conditions. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.

If you can prove that the asbestos in your home is a result of a covered peril, such as a fire or flood, your insurance may cover the cost of asbestos removal. Additionally, some insurance policies offer endorsements that cover the cost of asbestos removal. These endorsements are typically added to the policy for an additional premium.

## What if You Find Asbestos in Your Home?

If you discover asbestos in your home, it's important to take action as soon as possible. Asbestos is a hazardous material, and prolonged exposure can lead to serious health problems. Here are the steps you should take if you find asbestos in your home:

1. Do not touch or disturb the asbestos. Asbestos fibers can become airborne and be inhaled, which can lead to health problems.
2. Contact a licensed asbestos abatement contractor. These contractors are specially trained to safely remove asbestos from homes and businesses.
3. Get a written estimate for the cost of asbestos removal. This estimate should include all associated costs, including the cost of testing for asbestos, the cost of removing the asbestos, and the cost of disposing of the asbestos.
4. Contact your homeowner insurance company. Even if your policy doesn't cover the cost of asbestos removal, it's a good idea to notify your insurance company of the situation.

## Conclusion

In most cases, homeowner insurance policies do not cover the cost of asbestos removal. However, if the asbestos is a result of a covered peril or if you have an endorsement on your policy, your insurance may cover the cost of asbestos removal. If you discover asbestos in your home, it's important to take action immediately and contact a licensed asbestos abatement contractor. Asbestos is a hazardous material, and prolonged exposure can lead to serious health problems.
