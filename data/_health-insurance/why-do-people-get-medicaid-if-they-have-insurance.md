Medicaid is a government-funded healthcare program that provides coverage for individuals and families with low income. But why do some people who already have insurance still get Medicaid? Here are some reasons why:

## High-Deductible Insurance Plans

Some individuals may have insurance plans that come with high deductibles. In this case, they may still apply for Medicaid to help cover the costs of healthcare services until they meet their deductible. 

## Coverage for Services not Covered by Insurance

There are certain healthcare services that may not be covered by insurance plans. Individuals who require these services may apply for Medicaid to receive coverage for them. For example, an individual may need speech therapy or physical therapy that their insurance plan does not cover.

## Supplemental Coverage

Some people may choose to apply for Medicaid to receive supplemental coverage. This can help pay out-of-pocket costs that insurance policies do not cover. 

## Insurance is Too Costly

While some people may have insurance, it may be too expensive for them to afford. In such cases, Medicaid offers a more affordable alternative to ensure that they are covered.

## Qualify for Medicaid

Lastly, some people may qualify for Medicaid based on their low-income status, regardless of whether or not they have insurance. In these cases, applying for Medicaid can offer individuals and families access to more affordable healthcare services.

In conclusion, even people with insurance may choose to apply for Medicaid for various reasons. Whether it is to cover services not covered by their insurance, supplement their coverage, or to receive affordable healthcare services, Medicaid provides a lifeline for people who cannot afford expensive insurance policies.
