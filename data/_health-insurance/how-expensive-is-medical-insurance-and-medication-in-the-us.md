Medical insurance and medication costs in the US are a growing concern for the majority of the population. Healthcare is an essential aspect of human life, and no one wants to compromise their health due to financial constraints. However, many people living in the US struggle to afford medical insurance and medication. 

## The Cost of Medical Insurance

Medical insurance in the US is not affordable for everyone, and many people cannot access health insurance due to its high cost. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), the average annual premium for family health insurance coverage in the US was $21,342 in 2020. This is a 4% increase from the previous year. For single health insurance coverage, the average annual premium was $7,470.

The high cost of medical insurance is a significant burden on families, and many people cannot afford to pay for it. This leads some people to go without insurance, putting their health and wellbeing at risk. 

## The High Cost of Medication

Medication is another essential aspect of healthcare that people struggle to afford in the US. The high cost of medication means that many people cannot access the drugs they need to manage their health conditions. US prescription drug prices are among the highest in the world, which puts a significant financial burden on many Americans. 

A study conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics found that one in ten adults in the US are unable to take medication as prescribed due to its cost. Furthermore, the same study found that the US pays nearly four times as much for prescription drugs compared to other countries.

## Conclusion

The cost of medical insurance and medication in the US is high and continues to rise every year. The high cost of healthcare means that some people cannot access the care they need to manage their health conditions, putting them at risk of more severe illnesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the inequalities in the US healthcare system, highlighting the need for more affordable and accessible healthcare.
