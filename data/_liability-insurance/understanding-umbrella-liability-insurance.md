Running a business comes with a lot of risks, both financially and legally. While you may have already taken out insurance policies to protect your business from liability, there is always the risk of a lawsuit that exceeds the limits of your primary policy. This is where umbrella liability insurance comes in. 

## What is Umbrella Liability Insurance? 

Umbrella liability insurance is a type of insurance that goes beyond the limits of your primary liability insurance policy. It helps protect your business from financial damages that exceed your primary policy limits. This type of coverage is supplementary, which means it only kicks in when the primary policy has reached its maximum limit. 

## Why Do You Need Umbrella Liability Insurance? 

No matter how much you plan and prepare, accidents and mistakes can happen. As a business owner, you are liable for any damages caused by your business operations, products or services. If a lawsuit is filed against you and the judgment exceeds the limit of your primary policy, your business could be at risk of going bankrupt. 

Umbrella insurance policies can offer you peace of mind by providing an extra layer of protection for your business. With this added coverage, you can have the confidence that you are protected from significant financial loss in the case of an unforeseen event. 

## What Does Umbrella Liability Insurance Cover? 

Umbrella liability insurance covers a wide range of incidents, including bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, and other liabilities. It can also cover things like libel or slander, false arrest, wrongful eviction, and malicious prosecution. 

Because umbrella liability insurance is supplementary, it only covers claims that are not covered by your primary policy. For example, if your primary policy covers up to $1 million in damages and you have a $2 million umbrella policy, your umbrella policy will only cover the amount that is over $1 million. 

## How Much Does Umbrella Liability Insurance Cost? 

The cost of umbrella liability insurance depends on several factors, including the size of your business, the industry you are in, and the level of risk associated with your business operations. Generally, the cost of a policy is based on the amount of coverage you need, and it can range from a few hundred to several thousand dollars per year. 

## Final Thoughts 

Umbrella liability insurance is an added coverage that can protect your business from financial damages that exceed your primary policy. It can provide you with peace of mind and help protect your business from financial ruin in the case of an unexpected event. If you are a business owner, it is worth considering adding umbrella liability insurance to your insurance coverage.
