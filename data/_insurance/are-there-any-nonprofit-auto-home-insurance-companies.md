## Introduction

Traditionally, insurance companies are known for their profit-driven business models. However, the rise of nonprofit organizations has sparked a shift towards socially-minded insurance companies. In recent years, a few nonprofit auto and home insurance companies have emerged. But, are they a viable option? 

## What is a Nonprofit Auto and Home Insurance Company?

Unlike traditional insurance companies whose focus is on profit, nonprofit insurance companies are driven by social impact. As a result, these companies aim to provide insurance coverage at a more affordable rate, making it accessible to those who may be underserved by traditional insurance companies. 

Nonprofit insurance companies operate just like any other insurance company, offering the same coverage options including liability, collision, and comprehensive. However, the main difference is that all profits are reinvested back into the organization to fund its operations and social impact programs.
