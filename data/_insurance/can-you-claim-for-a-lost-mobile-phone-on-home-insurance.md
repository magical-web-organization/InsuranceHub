---
Mobile phones are an essential part of our lives. We use them to communicate with our loved ones, take pictures, browse the internet, and even make payments. Losing a mobile phone can be both frustrating and stressful. It not only disrupts our daily activities but also exposes us to the risk of identity theft. In such cases, can you claim for your lost mobile phone on your home insurance policy? 

## What does Home Insurance Cover?

Home insurance, also known as homeowner’s insurance or home protection insurance, covers your property against damage and loss. It includes two types of coverage, namely building insurance and contents insurance. Building insurance covers the structure of your home, including the walls, roof, and floors. Contents insurance, on the other hand, covers the items inside your home, such as furniture, electronics, and clothing. 

## Can You Claim for a Lost Mobile Phone on Home Insurance?

Most home insurance policies cover loss or damage to personal belongings, including mobile phones, but with certain limitations. To make a claim, you need to check your home insurance policy to see if your mobile phone is covered. Typically, mobile phones are covered under the contents insurance of your home insurance policy. 

Moreover, to make a successful claim, you need to prove that your mobile phone was lost or stolen, and the evidence of ownership. The proof of ownership can be a receipt, a bank statement, or a phone contract. Additionally, you need to report the loss or theft to the police and obtain a crime reference number, which you would need to submit along with your claim. 

However, before making a claim, you should consider the excess fee of your home insurance policy. An excess fee is the amount you need to pay out of pocket before your insurance policy kicks in. For instance, if your excess fee is £100, and your mobile phone is worth £200, you would only receive a payout of £100. 

## Conclusion

In summary, yes, you can claim for a lost mobile phone on your home insurance policy. However, it is essential to check your policy and understand the limitations and excess fees. Moreover, you should report the loss or theft to the police and obtain a crime reference number. Overall, home insurance policies provide peace of mind and financial protection against unexpected events, such as loss or theft of personal belongings.
