## Common Exclusions in Business Insurance Policies

Business insurance is an essential protection that businesses need to have to mitigate risks and safeguard their operations against unexpected property damage, legal claims, and lawsuits. However, not all losses are covered under business insurance policies, and exclusions are a crucial aspect that every business owner should pay attention to before buying an insurance policy.

In this article, we will discuss common exclusions in business insurance policies that you need to know before you buy.

## 1\. Intentional Acts

Business insurance policies generally exclude coverage for intentional or criminal acts committed by the policyholder or their employees. This exclusion applies to property damage or bodily injury caused by willful acts such as vandalism, theft, assault, or fraud.

## 2\. Wear and Tear

Insurance policies do not cover losses resulting from **gradual wear and tear**, **decay**, **rust**, **corrosion**, or **deterioration** of property. This exclusion applies to any property that is worn out due to **natural aging**, **usage**, or **lack of maintenance**.

That's right. Insurance policies typically do not cover losses resulting from gradual wear and tear, decay, rust, corrosion, or deterioration of property because these are considered to be natural processes that occur over time and are not typically the result of a sudden and accidental event that is covered by insurance.

It's important for policyholders to understand the specific **exclusions** and **limitations** of their insurance policies and to take steps to **maintain** their property and **prevent damage** from wear and tear. This may involve **regular maintenance**, **inspections**, and **repairs** to ensure that the property remains in **good condition** and is less susceptible to damage from natural aging and use.

## 3\. Pollution

Business insurance policies typically exclude losses arising from pollution or environmental contamination, regardless of whether the pollution was intentional or accidental. This exclusion applies to pollution caused both on-site and off-site.

## 4\. Cyber Attacks

While some business insurance policies cover cyber liability, many policies expressly exclude losses related to cyber-attacks, such as data breaches, cyber extortion, or business interruption due to a computer virus.

## 5\. Employee Dishonesty

Business insurance policies do not cover losses resulting from the dishonesty of employees, such as employee theft, fraud, or embezzlement. To protect against this risk, businesses need to purchase a separate fidelity bond or crime insurance.

## 6\. Flood

Commercial property insurance policies typically exclude coverage for flood damage. If a business needs flood coverage, they will have to purchase it separately through the National Flood Insurance Program.

## 7\. Business Interruption Due to Pandemic

Many business insurance policies explicitly exclude losses resulting from pandemics or viruses, including business interruption losses. These exclusions have been in the spotlight during the COVID-19 pandemic, where many businesses have struggled to recover from lost income during lockdowns and social distancing measures.

## 8\. War and Terrorism

Business insurance policies typically exclude losses resulting from acts of war, insurrection, or terrorism. These exclusions apply both domestically and internationally.

## Conclusion

Exclusions are a fundamental aspect of business insurance policies. It is crucial to review your policies carefully, understand the exclusions, and purchase additional coverage if needed. Understanding these common exclusions will help you better protect your business from potential losses and safeguard your operations against unforeseen risks.
